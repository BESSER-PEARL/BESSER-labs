# BESSER-labs

Welcome to BESSER-labs

This repository serves as a collaborative space for experimental work, ongoing development, and community contributions related to the [BESSER modeling platform](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER).

BESSER-labs is intended to host:

    üå± Work-in-progress features and ideas that are not yet part of the main BESSER repository.

    üß™ Prototypes or extensions that are being evaluated or refined.

    ü§ù External contributions from users and researchers interested in improving or extending BESSER.

The goal is to provide a flexible and open environment where new functionalities can be proposed, tested, and improved, before being considered for inclusion in the core platform.
